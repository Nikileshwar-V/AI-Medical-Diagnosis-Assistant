🔹 Symptom & Disease Reference

Fever is commonly caused by viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19, but bacterial infections like typhoid and pneumonia are also possible. Persistent fever above 38.5°C for more than 3 days requires medical evaluation.

Cough may result from viral respiratory infections, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, or pneumonia. A cough with yellow or green mucus can indicate bacterial infection.

Sore throat is usually associated with viral infections like flu, but bacterial infections such as strep throat can cause severe throat pain with fever.

Chest pain combined with cough and fever suggests pneumonia or severe bronchitis. Sudden severe chest pain, especially with breathlessness, may indicate cardiac emergency.

Shortness of breath can be caused by pneumonia, asthma, COVID-19, heart failure, or pulmonary embolism. Immediate medical attention is required if breathing difficulty worsens or oxygen level drops.

Fatigue and weakness can follow infections or be associated with anemia, metabolic disorders, or chronic diseases.

Headache with fever and neck stiffness may suggest meningitis, which requires urgent medical treatment.

Body pain and chills are common in viral infections like influenza and dengue. Persistent severe body pain with rash and vomiting may indicate dengue fever.

Diarrhea with dehydration risk occurs in gastroenteritis. Severe diarrhea with bloody stools may indicate bacterial infection requiring antibiotics.

Vomiting and abdominal pain may occur in gastritis, food poisoning, appendicitis, or viral infection. Persistent right-lower abdominal pain and fever may indicate appendicitis.

🔹 Emergency Red-Flag Symptoms

Seek immediate medical care if the patient has:

Difficulty breathing or persistent shortness of breath

Chest pain or tightness radiating to arm/jaw

High fever > 39.5°C lasting > 72 hours

Severe dehydration or inability to drink fluids

Confusion, drowsiness, or seizures

Rash with bleeding or bruising (possible dengue/sepsis)

Persistent vomiting with abdominal rigidity

Severe headache with neck stiffness

Sudden loss of consciousness

🔹 Possible Diagnoses by Symptoms
Symptom Cluster	Likely Condition
High fever, cough, chest pain	Pneumonia, severe bronchitis, influenza
Sore throat + fever + swollen glands	Tonsillitis or strep throat
Cough + wheeze + breathlessness	Asthma or COPD
Fever + joint pain + rash	Dengue or chikungunya
Fever + diarrhea/vomiting	Gastroenteritis, food poisoning
Sudden chest pain + breathlessness	Cardiac emergency or pulmonary embolism
Headache + fever + neck stiffness	Meningitis
🔹 Treatment Guidance (General Advice)

Viral infections: rest, oral fluids, paracetamol, ORS for dehydration

Bacterial infections: may require antibiotics (doctor prescription only)

Persistent cough/asthma: consider bronchodilators (doctor evaluation needed)

High fever: paracetamol every 6-8 hrs, sponge bath for very high fever

Hydration: ORS for diarrhea, electrolyte fluids

Dengue suspected: avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen, monitor platelets

Avoid self-medication with antibiotics or steroids

🔹 When to Seek Doctor Care

Consult a doctor if:

Fever lasts > 3 days

Severe cough persists > 2 weeks

Chest pain or breathing difficulty

Persistent vomiting or diarrhea

Rash with fever

Symptoms worsen despite home care

🔹 Home-Care Instructions

Drink 2-3 liters of water daily

Rest and avoid exertion

Eat light meals — soups, rice, fruits

Use steam inhalation for congestion

Warm salt-water gargle for sore throat

🔹 High-Risk Patients

Age above 60

Diabetes

Hypertension

Chronic lung or kidney disease

Heart problems

Immunocompromised status
